      <h1>Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</h1>
      <p>The new Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020) isn't just the best laptop Apple has ever made, it's the best laptop money can buy right now. This is the first time a MacBook has topped our best laptops list, but the MacBook Air is worthy of this spot. Thanks to the revolutionary ARM-based Apple M1 chip that powers the new MacBook Air, this is a stunning achievement: a thin and light laptop that offers great performance, even with 4K video editing, while also offering incredible battery life. Easily managing over 11 hours on a single charge, this is a laptop you can easily carry around with you at work or school, and its price is incredibly competitive compared to Windows 10 rivals like the Dell XPS 15.</p>

      <h1>Dell XPS 13 (2020) </h1>
      <p>The Dell XPS 13 (2020) with Intel Evo is a gorgeous little machine that offers excellent performance, battery life, and more. It comes at the expense of ports, sound quality, and price, but none of these are enough for us to not highly recommend this laptop to anyone in the market for an ultrabook.The latest Dell XPS 13 keeps all the things we loved about this year’s previous model, such as a smaller frame, four-sided InfinityEdge bezels and a larger keyboard.</p>

    <h1>Acer Swift 3 (2020)</h1>
    <p>Beyond the Acer Swift 3's modest exterior, you'll find an excellent laptop that boasts plenty of power for work and study. The Swift 3 (not to be confused with the Switch 3 another laptop from Acer) is an inexpensive laptop; however, that plain chassis is all-aluminum and packed with beefy components. <br>This laptop is incredible to use as well, with its roomy trackpad as well as its backlit keyboard that offers a comfortable typing experience with decent travel. If you're going to be writing a lot – whether you’re traveling or at the office, this is one of the best budget laptops 2020 has on offer.</p>

    <h1>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2020)</h1>
    <p>Asus is stepping up its game when it comes to gaming laptops. Case in point, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. Powered by AMD's new powerful Ryzen 9-4900HS processor, the laptop is a powerful multitasker. Top that off with a lightning-fast SSD, a bright, 14-inch, 120Hz display, a comfortable keyboard and strong speakers packed into a gorgeous milky-white magnesium alloy chassis, and the ROG Zephyrus G14 is a near-perfect gaming laptop.<br>But where the Zephyrus G14 really shines is its battery life. The top-rated laptop lasted 11 hours and 32 minutes on our Laptop Mag Battery test, making it the longest-lasting gaming laptop ever.</p>
